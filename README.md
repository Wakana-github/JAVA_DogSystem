This is a program written in JAVA that allows dog breeders to store their dogs' information. 
It can display a list of dogs, display dogs by their breeds and prices, display the total price of all dogs in the list, and add or delete dogs from the list. 
The repository includes 3 classes that define dogs' attributes (Dog.java), a subclass of dog (PedigreeDog.java), and their functions (DogBreeder.java), as well as 2 test programs and a class diagram for the system.
